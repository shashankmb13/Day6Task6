Strong Password Creation and Strength Evaluation

🔐 Strong Password Creation and Strength Evaluation
📌 Objective

Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

🛠️ Tools Used

Password Meter

Security.org Password Strength Tester

Kaspersky Password Checker

📑 Steps Followed

Created multiple passwords with varying complexity.

Used uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations.

Tested each password on password strength checkers.

Collected scores and tool feedback.

Identified best practices for creating strong passwords.

Documented lessons learned.

Researched password attacks (brute force, dictionary, credential stuffing).

Summarized how password complexity improves security.

📊 Password Strength Evaluation
Password Example	Complexity Level	Strength Result	Feedback
12345	Very Weak	❌ Easily guessable	Too short, only numbers, common sequence
Password123	Weak	❌ Low–Medium	Predictable, common pattern
P@ssw0rd!	Medium	⚠️ Medium	Better but still predictable
Tr0ub4dor&3	Strong	✅ High	Good mix, harder to guess
G$7vL!p#rX8zQ2kM	Very Strong	✅✅ Very High	Random, long, highly secure
✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Use 12–16+ characters.

Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid common dictionary words or predictable substitutions.

Prefer random passphrases (e.g., Sky!Tree8$Moon_River).

Do not reuse passwords across sites.

Use password managers to generate/store securely.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for extra security.

📝 Lessons Learned

Password length is more important than just complexity.

Attackers know common substitutions (e.g., P@ssw0rd).

Random + long + unique passwords resist most attacks.

Passphrases are easier to remember and still strong.

🚨 Common Password Attacks

Brute Force → Tries every possible combination.

Dictionary Attack → Uses common words/phrases.

Credential Stuffing → Reuses leaked password lists.

🎯 Conclusion

Password complexity and uniqueness directly enhance security. Strong, random, and lengthy passwords, combined with 2FA, provide the best defense against brute-force and dictionary attacks.
